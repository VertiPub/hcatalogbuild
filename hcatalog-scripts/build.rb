This is an command to automate the build of the hcatalog project from source.
It assumes a wrapper git repository with a submodule of the actual project to be built.
It's a first attempt make this more modular so it can be refactored to also be used to 
build other projects via a shared common script.

Assumptions:

	1.  WORKSPACE is defined, either via execution within Jenkins or by the user
	2.  The "wrapper" repository has been cloned and the version checked out for use.
        3.  The "wrapper" repository exists at the level of WORKSPACE (ala Jenkins)
        4.  The build script will generate the necessary artifacts to be used by the install script
            a.  The build script will be passed an "ARTIFACT_VERSION" environment variable
            b.  The build script will be passed the "DATE_STRING" environment variable should it need it
            c.  The build script will inherit the "WORKSPACE"  environment variable
            d.  The build script will execute in the submodule directory
            e.  The build script will have a non-zero exit if the build fails for any reason
        5.  The install script will generate the proper build root when passed the correct install directory, and build the RPM
            a.  The build script will be passed an "ARTIFACT_VERSION" environment variable
            b.  The build script will be passed the "DATE_STRING" environment variable should it need it
            c.  The build script will be passed the "INSTALL_DIR" into which to unpack the artifacts created by the build script
            d.  The build script will be passed the "RPM_DIR" into which to place the built RPM
            e.  The build script will inherit the "WORKSPACE"  environment variable
            f.  The build will pass in a description in a single quoted string in the "DESCRIPTION" env variable
        6.  If the JOB_URL is defined it will be included in the Description, otherwise a snide comment will be included
